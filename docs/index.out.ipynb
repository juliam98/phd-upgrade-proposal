    "The <span class=\"gls\">NMDA</span> hypofunction hypothesis of schizophrenia proposes that decreased activity of <span class=\"gls\">NMDA</span> receptors has a key role in the development of schizophrenia pathology. The affected <span class=\"gls\">NMDA</span> receptors are primarily localised at <span class=\"gls\">GABA</span>-ergic fast-spiking <span class=\"gls\">PV</span> interneurons; where decreased activity of <span class=\"gls\">PV</span> interneurons causes a disinhibition of their activity on pyramidal neurons, disrupting the <span class=\"gls\">EI</span> balance, and leading to increased excitation. Hyperactivity in the hippocampus is observed in the early stages in schizophrenia, as well as in people at clinical high risk of schizophrenia that subsequently develop the disorders, suggesting this region might be implicated in the development of the pathology at early stages of the disorder. This is consistent with the observations that administation of <span class=\"gls\">NMDA</span> antagonists like phencyclidine and ketamine induces behaviours comparable to all three schizoprenia symptom dimensions (positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms) (citations from ([Nakazawa and Sapkota 2020](#ref-nakazawa_origin_2020))), and repeated administration results in increased release of <span class=\"gls\">DA</span> in rodent striatum citations from ([Nakazawa and Sapkota 2020](#ref-nakazawa_origin_2020)), suggesting that hyperdopaminergia is caused by decreased <span class=\"gls\">NMDA</span> activity ([Grace 2012](#ref-grace_dopamine_2012), [2016](#ref-grace_dysregulation_2016)).\n",

    "Alterations in synaptic function have also been implicated in the aetiology of schizophrenia ([Howes and Onwordi 2023](#ref-howes_synaptic_2023)). Excitotoxicity caused by increased glutamatergic activity might be one of the contributing factors in the reduction in synaptic connections in schizophrenia. Postmortem studies have reported decreased ([Abdallah et al. 2018](#ref-abdallah_effects_2018))\n",

    "\n",
    "-   The aim of my project is to examine the relationship between synaptic connectivity and glutamatergic function. To do this I will measure the difference in glutamate levels (MRS) after administration of LEV and placebo in healthy controls and people with schizophrenia.\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  Does modulating SV2A lead to lower glutamate levels in healthy people?\n",
    "2.  Does modulating SV2A lead to lower glutamate levels in people with schizophrenia? Is the change different to that in healthy controls?\n",
